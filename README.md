# ACM Hack's Tooling Series - Spring 2020

## Welcome to ACM Hack's Tooling Series
There is a world of software tools that all of STEM can use. In this workshop series, we go through some tools specific to programmers like git, vim, and VSCode to more widely applicable tools like LaTeX (pronouned LAY-tek). Because classes have all been moved online, we will host our workshops on Zoom!

In this repository, you'll find a guidemap to all the topics we introduce this quarter, and links to helpful resources. These resourses, which are often what we call "READMEs", are very useful for following along and reading up on content you missed!
