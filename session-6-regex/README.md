## Mini Project

We'll be getting a list of youtube links from your Facebook messages to someone! Fill out the regular expression in the program `get_youtube_links.py`. 

A sample set of messages is found in `messages.json`. There are 7 links you can try to match there.

If you want to do this with your own Facebook messages, go to "Settings" > "Your Facebook Information". Then click "Download Your Information." Uncheck everything except messages. Choose your preferred date range, JSON format and low media quality. After requesting, you can go to the "Available Copies" tab to see your pending copy. It will take some time before it is available. 

[TODO]You can turn it into a playlist with http://www.youtubeplaylist.org/ or https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/72787/how-to-create-a-youtube-playlist-from-a-list-of-links.
